        "\n",
        "1)Advanced feature matching and a full-fledged feature transformer were the central elements of my preprocessing pipeline. I (we) added logarithms, quadratic features, and limited interactions between the most important variables, and also separated numerical and categorical data with subsequent scaling and category encoding using StandardScaler and OneHotEncoder, respectively. These solutions have been chosen because target variables, fuel consumption and price, clearly depend nonlinearly on a number of factors, and a simple linear model without enriching features is not flexible. Besides, different types of data need different normalization, so, one pipeline using ColumnTransformer will ensure correct processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "2)I (we) looked at the effectiveness of each element, measuring the change in model quality on training and validation data after adding the corresponding part of the pipeline. In particular, the inclusion of logarithms and quadratic features significantly improved the R^2 of fuel consumption predictions, while standardization reduced the dispersion of results for RidgeCV, making the selection of hyperparameters more stable. I (we) also analyzed what kinds of interactions actually provided benefit: some combinations failed to improve metrics or resulted in overfitting, as evidenced by an increase in in-sample R^2 without a similar improvement in out-of-sample predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3)Some ideas have been tried and abandoned. For instance, exhaustive enumeration of all interactions between features resulted in too high a dimensionality and impeded the generalization ability of the model. I (we) also tried clustering cars for subsequent training of individual models within clusters but found inconsistent results with increased pipeline complexity without significant benefit. Several attempts to use PCA for dimensionality reduction seemed promising, but due to the highly interpretable nature of the original features and the heterogeneity of the categorical encodings, PCA did not yield significant gains. At the end, I (we) had to settle on a combination of featuring and a careful regularized linear model because it was this combination that provided stable and reproducible quality."

        "1)I (we) chose a modeling strategy based on two coordinated components: a multi-output linear model for fuel-efficiency targets and a separate regularized model for price prediction. This approach emerged naturally from exploratory experiments showing that mileage variables behave similarly and benefit from being modeled jointly, while price exhibits different variance patterns and is more sensitive to specific features. I (we) chose RidgeCV as the core estimator because regularization stabilizes coefficients under expanded feature engineering, and automated hyperparameter selection reduces the risk of manually tuning an overly complex search space. My (our) assumption was that combining enriched features with a controlled-capacity linear model would preserve interpretability while still capturing meaningful nonlinearities introduced during preprocessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "2)I (we) evaluated the performance of each modeling decision by comparing R² values and error distributions on both training and validation splits after every architectural change. Multi-output modeling improved coherence between city and highway MPG predictions, confirming that these targets indeed share useful structure. At the same time, I (we) observed that modeling price independently prevented its errors from being amplified by the dynamics of the MPG-related submodel. Regularization strength selected via cross-validation provided a strong balance between bias and variance, which I (we) confirmed through stable out-of-sample performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "3)I (we) tried several alternative approaches that ultimately did not justify their complexity. We tested tree-based ensembles like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, but their performance gains were marginal considering the loss of interpretability and increased sensitivity to preprocessing. Applying a single global multi-output model for all three targets produced unstable price predictions, likely due to conflicting loss geometry across tasks. I (we) also considered stacking and blending, but the dataset was too small to reliably support such architectures. All these observations reinforced my (our) final choice: a pair of regularized linear models with structured feature engineering and explicit grouping of targets."

        "1. Try higher order feature interactions and polynomial features on a small subsample. Then identify key features or select key principal components. The final model can be trained on a larger or even full training sample. You can use [PCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) to reduce the feature set\n",
